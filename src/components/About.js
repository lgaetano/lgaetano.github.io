            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a former TeamUSA canoeist with 6+ years of patient 
                care experience as an emergency medical technician on a 911 
                ambulance who absolutely loves fast-paced problem solving, 
                making resources accessible and finding ways to improve processes.
                
                <br /><br />I want to find my career in the space where tech, healthcare and 
                accessibility overlap. To get there, I'm very excited to announce 
                that I am part of Cohort 16 at Ada Developers Academy, after recently 
                completing General Assembly's Data Science bootcamp on a scholarship 
                from the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and the 
                Adecco Group.
